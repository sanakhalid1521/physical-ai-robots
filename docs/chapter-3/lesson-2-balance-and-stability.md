# Balance and Stability

Balance is one of the most critical challenges in humanoid robotics. Unlike wheeled or multi-legged robots, bipedal robots have a small support base and must actively maintain their balance through continuous control.

## Balance Control Strategies

### Ankle Strategy
- Small perturbations are corrected primarily through ankle movements
- Maintains the body as a single inverted pendulum
- Most efficient for minor balance adjustments

### Hip Strategy
- Larger perturbations require hip movements
- Creates a double-inverted pendulum model
- More energy-intensive but necessary for larger disturbances

### Stepping Strategy
- When other strategies fail, stepping is used
- Changes the support base to restore balance
- Last resort to prevent falling

## Stability Metrics

### Center of Mass (CoM)
The point where the robot's mass is concentrated. For stability, the CoM projection must remain within the support polygon.

### Capture Point
The point where a robot must step to come to a complete stop. Used in advanced balance control algorithms.

### Angular Momentum
Control of whole-body angular momentum is crucial for maintaining balance during dynamic movements.

## Balance Control Algorithms

### Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM)
A simplified model that treats the robot as a point mass on a massless leg. Useful for planning stable walking patterns.

### Cart-Table Model
An extension of LIPM that includes both horizontal and vertical center of mass movement.

### Whole-Body Control
Advanced control that considers all degrees of freedom simultaneously for optimal balance.

## Hands-On Activity

Design a simple balance control system for a humanoid robot. Consider how you would detect when the robot is losing balance and what corrective actions could be taken. Create a flowchart showing the decision process for selecting between ankle, hip, and stepping strategies based on the magnitude of the balance disturbance.
