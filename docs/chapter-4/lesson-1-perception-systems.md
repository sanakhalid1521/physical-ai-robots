# Perception Systems

Perception systems in humanoid robots allow them to understand and interpret their environment. These systems are crucial for navigation, interaction, and safe operation in human environments.

## Types of Perception

### Proprioception
- Internal sensing of the robot's state
- Joint angles, velocities, and torques
- IMU data for orientation and acceleration
- Essential for balance and control

### Exteroception
- Sensing of the external environment
- Vision, audition, touch, and other modalities
- Critical for interaction and navigation
- Provides context for action planning

## Vision Systems

### Camera Systems
- RGB cameras for color image capture
- Depth cameras for 3D information
- Stereo vision for depth estimation
- Fisheye cameras for wide field of view

### Visual Processing
- Object detection and recognition
- Scene understanding
- Human detection and tracking
- Environment mapping

## Other Sensory Systems

### Tactile Sensing
- Force/torque sensors in hands and feet
- Tactile skin for fine manipulation
- Contact detection and force control
- Critical for safe human interaction

### Auditory Systems
- Microphone arrays for sound localization
- Speech recognition for human interaction
- Environmental sound analysis
- Noise filtering for robust operation

## Sensor Fusion

### Data Integration
- Combining information from multiple sensors
- Improving accuracy and reliability
- Handling sensor failures gracefully
- Creating consistent world models

### Temporal Integration
- Tracking objects over time
- Filtering noisy sensor data
- Predicting future states
- Maintaining consistent estimates

## Hands-On Activity

Design a simple sensor fusion system that combines data from a camera and an IMU to estimate the position of an object in space. Consider how each sensor has different strengths and weaknesses, and how their combination can provide better estimates than either sensor alone. Sketch out the data flow and identify where sensor fusion would occur in your system.
