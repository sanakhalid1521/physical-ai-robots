# Sensor Fusion

Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to achieve better accuracy, reliability, and robustness than could be achieved by any single sensor alone. In humanoid robots, sensor fusion is critical for reliable perception and control.

## Why Sensor Fusion?

### Redundancy
- Multiple sensors provide backup if one fails
- Increased system reliability
- Graceful degradation when sensors fail
- Critical for safety in humanoid robots

### Complementary Information
- Different sensors provide different types of data
- Combining strengths while mitigating weaknesses
- More complete environmental understanding
- Better decision making

### Improved Accuracy
- Statistical combination reduces uncertainty
- Multiple measurements improve estimates
- Filtering removes noise and outliers
- More robust to sensor errors

## Fusion Techniques

### Kalman Filtering
- Optimal for linear systems with Gaussian noise
- Recursive estimation of system state
- Combines predictions with measurements
- Widely used in robot localization

### Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- For nonlinear systems
- Linearizes around current estimate
- More complex but more general
- Common in robot SLAM systems

### Particle Filtering
- For non-Gaussian and multimodal distributions
- Represents probability distribution with samples
- More computationally intensive
- Good for complex, uncertain environments

## Sensor Fusion Architectures

### Centralized Fusion
- All data processed at a central location
- Optimal but computationally intensive
- Single point of failure
- Good for systems with powerful central processing

### Distributed Fusion
- Processing occurs near sensors
- Reduced communication requirements
- More robust to communication failures
- Requires coordination between nodes

### Hierarchical Fusion
- Multiple levels of fusion
- Combines benefits of centralized and distributed
- More complex coordination required
- Good for large multi-sensor systems

## Common Sensor Combinations

### Visual-Inertial Fusion
- Combines camera and IMU data
- Visual provides absolute measurements
- IMU provides high-frequency motion data
- Essential for robust SLAM

### LIDAR-Inertial Fusion
- LIDAR for precise distance measurements
- IMU for motion compensation
- Robust for outdoor navigation
- Good for mapping and localization

## Challenges in Fusion

### Time Synchronization
- Sensors may operate at different rates
- Communication delays affect fusion
- Need for accurate timestamps
- Interpolation for asynchronous data

### Data Association
- Matching measurements to objects
- Critical for tracking applications
- Complex in cluttered environments
- False associations degrade performance

## Hands-On Activity

Design a simple sensor fusion system for estimating a humanoid robot's position. Consider fusing data from wheel encoders, IMU, and camera. Create a block diagram showing how the different sensors' data would be combined. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor, and how their combination would improve the overall position estimate compared to using each sensor alone.
