# Adaptive Control

Adaptive control systems can modify their behavior based on changing conditions or system parameters. For humanoid robots, adaptive control is essential for handling uncertainties in the environment and changes in the robot's own properties over time.

## Need for Adaptation

### Environmental Changes
- Different terrains and surfaces
- Varying friction and compliance
- Dynamic obstacles and humans
- Changing lighting conditions

### System Changes
- Wear and tear of components
- Load variations
- Parameter drift over time
- Component replacement

### Uncertainty Handling
- Unknown or changing system parameters
- Modeling errors
- External disturbances
- Unpredicted interactions

## Adaptive Control Strategies

### Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)
- Reference model defines desired behavior
- Controller adapts to match reference model
- Good for known desired behavior
- Requires reference model design

### Self-Tuning Regulators (STR)
- System identification combined with control
- Parameters updated based on system behavior
- Good for slowly varying systems
- Requires persistent excitation

### Gain Scheduling
- Control parameters based on operating conditions
- Pre-computed parameter sets for different conditions
- Good for known operating regimes
- Limited to predefined conditions

## Learning-Based Adaptation

### Online Learning
- Continuous learning during operation
- Updates based on recent experiences
- Balances exploration and exploitation
- Requires safety constraints

### Meta-Learning
- Learning to learn quickly
- Fast adaptation to new conditions
- Prior knowledge for rapid learning
- Good for changing environments

### Multi-Task Learning
- Sharing knowledge across tasks
- Improved sample efficiency
- Transfer between related tasks
- Better generalization

## Applications in Humanoid Robotics

### Walking Adaptation
- Adapting gait to different terrains
- Adjusting to different payloads
- Handling leg wear or damage
- Balancing on unstable surfaces

### Manipulation Adaptation
- Adapting grasp strategies
- Adjusting to object properties
- Learning from failures
- Human-like skill improvement

### Balance Adaptation
- Adjusting to different body configurations
- Adapting to surface compliance
- Handling external disturbances
- Learning from near-fall experiences

## Challenges

### Stability
- Ensuring stable adaptation
- Preventing parameter drift
- Maintaining safety during learning
- Guaranteeing convergence

### Safety
- Safe exploration during adaptation
- Maintaining performance bounds
- Failure recovery mechanisms
- Human safety during learning

## Hands-On Activity

Design an adaptive control system for a humanoid robot walking on different surfaces (grass, concrete, sand). Consider how the robot could detect the surface type and adapt its walking parameters accordingly. Identify which parameters might need adjustment (step length, step timing, foot placement, balance control gains) and how the robot could learn the appropriate settings for each surface type.
