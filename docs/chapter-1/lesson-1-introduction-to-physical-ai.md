# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI is a field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems. It focuses on creating intelligent agents that can interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI differs from traditional AI in that it must account for the physical properties of the world. This includes understanding concepts like force, motion, friction, and gravity.

## Key Concepts

- Embodiment: AI systems with physical form
- Sensorimotor learning: Learning through interaction with the environment
- Real-world constraints: Physical laws that govern behavior

## Hands-On Activity

Create a simple simulation of a ball bouncing using a physics engine. Observe how changing parameters like gravity and elasticity affect the behavior.

```javascript
// Example physics simulation
const ball = {
  position: { x: 0, y: 10 },
  velocity: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  gravity: 9.8,
  bounceFactor: 0.8
};
```

Try implementing the physics equations for the ball's motion and see how it behaves differently with various parameters.
