# Basics of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are robots with human-like characteristics and form. They are designed to interact with human environments and potentially work alongside humans.

## Anatomy of a Humanoid Robot

Humanoid robots typically have:
- Head with sensors (cameras, microphones)
- Torso with upper and lower body
- Arms with hands for manipulation
- Legs for locomotion

## Key Components

- Actuators: Motors that provide movement
- Sensors: Devices that perceive the environment
- Controllers: Systems that coordinate movements
- Power systems: Batteries or other power sources

## Hands-On Activity

Design the kinematic chain for a simple humanoid arm. Create a diagram showing the joints and degrees of freedom from shoulder to hand.

Consider the following joint types:
- Revolute joints (rotation around one axis)
- Prismatic joints (linear motion)
- Spherical joints (multiple axes of rotation)

Sketch out how many degrees of freedom you think are needed for different tasks like reaching, grasping, and manipulation.
